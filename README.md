## 🧠 Overview  

**Metro Exodus** is a cinematic first-person shooter that combines intense combat, exploration, and survival mechanics within a deeply atmospheric narrative. Set in a devastated post-nuclear world, the game follows Artyom and his companions as they escape the tunnels of the Moscow Metro in search of a new life beyond the ruins.

Unlike traditional linear shooters, Metro Exodus introduces large, open-ended locations that reward exploration and careful planning. Players must manage limited resources, customize weapons on the fly, and adapt to changing environments shaped by weather and time of day.

The game places strong emphasis on immersion, with minimal interface elements, realistic weapon handling, and a living world that reacts to player choices. Every encounter can be approached with stealth, strategy, or direct confrontation, allowing for a personalized experience throughout the journey.
